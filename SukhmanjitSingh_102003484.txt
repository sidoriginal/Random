3)Used functions such as socket(),sockaddr_in,bind(),listen() and many more.
4)First made the server client on same pc which ran correctly
5)Then tried to make server and client on two separate computer systems which was not sending messages
6)Sir made a change of line in the code which made it run correctly.
